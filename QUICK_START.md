# Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Get Started in 5 Minutes

This guide will help you get the QR Ticket System running locally in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ installed
- pip package manager
- Basic terminal/command line knowledge

## Step 1: Extract the Project

If you have the archive file:
```bash
tar -xzf qr_ticket_system_complete.tar.gz
cd qr_ticket_system_project
```

If you already have the project folder:
```bash
cd qr_ticket_system_project
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- Django 4.2.7
- gunicorn
- psycopg2-binary
- dj-database-url
- whitenoise
- qrcode
- Pillow

## Step 3: Run the Server

The database is already set up with migrations applied, so you can start immediately:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see:
```
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Step 4: Access the Application

### üé´ Create a Ticket (No Login Required)

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000/event/1/
```

1. Enter your name
2. Enter number of plus ones (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
3. Click "Davetiyemi Olu≈ütur"
4. Your ticket with QR code will be displayed
5. Download or screenshot the QR code

## Step 5: Test the Full Flow

### Complete Workflow Test:

1. **Create an Event (Admin)**
   - Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/
   - Login as admin
   - Click "Events" ‚Üí "Add Event"
   - Fill in event details
   - Save

2. **Generate a Ticket (Attendee)**
   - Go to http://localhost:8000/event/1/ (or your event ID)
   - Enter name and plus ones
   - Submit form
   - Download QR code

3. **Scan the Ticket (Scanner)**
   - Go to http://localhost:8000/login/
   - Login as scanner
   - Allow camera access
   - Point camera at QR code
   - Verify check-in works

## üì± Testing on Mobile

### Option 1: Using ngrok (Recommended)

Install ngrok:
```bash
# Download from https://ngrok.com/download
# Or use package manager
brew install ngrok  # macOS
```

Run ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

You'll get a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

Access from your phone:
```
https://abc123.ngrok.io/event/1/
```

### Option 2: Local Network

Find your local IP:
```bash
# On macOS/Linux
ifconfig | grep "inet "

# On Windows
ipconfig
```

Update `settings.py`:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']  # Already set
```

Access from your phone (same WiFi):
```
http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8000/event/1/
```

## üé® Customization

### Change Event Details

Edit in admin panel or via shell:
```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from tickets.models import Event
event = Event.objects.get(id=1)
event.name = "My Custom Event"
event.location = "My Venue"
event.max_tickets = 200
event.save()
```

### Change Admin Password

```bash
python manage.py changepassword admin
```

### Create Additional Scanner Users

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
User.objects.create_user('scanner2', 'scanner2@example.com', 'password123')
```

### Customize Colors and Styling

Edit `tickets/templates/tickets/base.html`:
- Change gradient colors in the `<style>` section
- Modify Bootstrap classes
- Add custom CSS

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port 8000 Already in Use

Use a different port:
```bash
python manage.py runserver 8080
```

### Camera Not Working

Requirements for camera access:
- HTTPS connection (use ngrok)
- Browser permissions granted
- Camera not in use by another app

### QR Codes Not Displaying

Check media directory exists:
```bash
mkdir -p media/qr_codes
```

Ensure media files are served (already configured in `urls.py`).

### Static Files Not Loading

Collect static files:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### Database Errors

Reset database:
```bash
rm db.sqlite3
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
